Caveats:
"1. 'Missing County' appears when county data is not available for a certain year. This occurs because the county did not meet"
"minimum population standards and thus the data for the county was recoded to the ""Unidentified Counties"" category for the"
"state of the county. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/Natality.html#Locations."
"2. 'Suppressed' appears when the data do not meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/Natality.html#Assurance of Confidentiality."
"3. Each birth record represents one living baby."
"4. County-level data are shown only for counties with populations of 100,000 persons or more. Within each state, data for all"
"counties with fewer than 100,000 persons are combined together under the label ""Unidentified Counties."""

"residing in a reporting area that used the 1989 U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth or did not report Tobacco Use in the"
"specified data year. All reporting areas, except California, routinely collect information on Maternal Tobacco Use, but"
"information from the 2003 revision of the birth certificate is not comparable to the information based on the earlier"
